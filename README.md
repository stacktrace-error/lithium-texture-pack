# lithium-texture-pack
A texture pack that attempts to mimic the look an old iteration of the logic system.

You can swap out the existing sprites with the ones in the `alt-sprites` folder or PR your own alternative sprites if you'd like, if I think they're better than the current ones they may become part of the pack by default.

Note that updates won't happen very often, I am slightly busy with other things at the moment.

(Don't question the name, it needs some context which I'm not going to mention.)
